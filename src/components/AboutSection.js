I am French, leaving in Switzerland. A place of beauty and nature.
I like the process of creating unique solutions that will solve complex problems.
To observe, to measure, to model, to analyze and then design the solution are
a passion for me. I enjoyed the process a lot.
<br /> <br />
I am graduate from Biomedical engineer school in France and I had several roles in
medical companies. I started coding since I was in my first job more than 10 years ago.
I kept learning new langages and competences that helps me to achieve better results
in my activities.
<br /> <br />
Now I would like to take the opportunity to design solutions along with the coding.
Web development is for the solution that will bring me my Ikiga√Ø.
