                    I am French, leaving in Switzerland. A place of beauty and nature.
                    I like the process of creating unique solutions that will solve complex problems.
                    To observe, to measure, to model, to analyze and then design the solution are
                    a passion for me. I enjoyed the process a lot.
                    <br /> <br />
                    I am graduate from Biomedical engineer school in France and I had several roles in
                    medical companies. I started coding since I was in my first job more than 10 years ago.
                    I kept learning new langages and competences that helps me to achieve better results
                    in my activities.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Now I would like to take the opportunity to design solutions along with the coding.
                    Web development is for the solution that will bring me my Ikiga√Ø.
